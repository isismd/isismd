<br/>

I'm Isis Daron, a Front-End developer and Computer Science student at the Federal University of Mato Grosso. I entered the development world in late 2021, and for the past six months I have been working as an Front-End Intern, primarily utilizing the Vue framework. Additionally, I actively contribute as a volunteer developer at my university's junior company, where we use React library.


-`🪐´- Current Focus:

I am currently dedicated to enhancing my Front-End skills by delving deeper into JavaScript-based libraries and frameworks (mostly Vue and Next.js). I also like to venture into the world of Web Design (check my [Behance](https://www.behance.net/isismd)) and have a great interest in machine learning algorithms and data analysis.

-`💌´- How to Reach Me:
